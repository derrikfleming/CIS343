# cis343Reverse
This C program reads in a text file, and then writes it back to a new file in reverse.
It illustrates how to dynamically allocate memory globally and access dynamically allocated
memory globally by using pointers and pointers to pointers. 

When launched from terminal 3 arguments are necessary: <executable_name> <name_of_file_to_read> <name_of_file_to_write>
